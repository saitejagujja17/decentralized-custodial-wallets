PROJECT:Decentralized Custodial Wallet Models

This project explores and compares three decentralized custodial wallet mechanisms on Ethereum:
- Time-Locked Wallets
- Multisig Control (e.g., Gnosis Safe-style)
- Inheritance Protocols (e.g., Dead Man’s Switch)

Our goal is to evaluate these models based on security, usability, and user control, and to build a prototype for one (Time-Locked ETH Wallet).
